# Processing controller

The Processing controller is a graphical desktop application for controlling
the parameters of a running Colordance via serial. It has graphical controls
like sliders, and outputs their values to a serial port when they change.

## Building and running

First, install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) if you don't
already have it. You'll also need the
[ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5) library, which you can
install using Processing's library manager.

Open the sketch in Processing and run it from there.
